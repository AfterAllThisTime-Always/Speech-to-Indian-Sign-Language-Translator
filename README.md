# Speech-to-Indian-Sign-Language-Translator
A tool to translate Speech (native code supports Hindi, but can be changed for whichever language is required) into Indian Speech Language. The application takes speech as input, converts it into text and then displays appropriate ISL (Indian Speech Language) GIFs or images.

*Speech as input through device's microphone with the help of SpeechRecognition Module.
*Speech Recognition and translation using Google's Speech to Text API and PocketSphinx. The latter module helps in carrying out the tasks when there is no Internet Connection and Google's Speech to Text API fails to work.
